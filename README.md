# Palettizer

Palettizer is a NodeJS application meant to act as a backend service that generates palette files for various art programs based on a JSON payload to it's POST routes. It is not meant to be user-facing, instead requiring an intermediatory service or app for optimal user experience.

## Installation / Contributing

As the app doesn't use anything that requires transpilation or pre-processing nor does it require any 3rd party services to run, installing it for use or to modify is a simple 3 step process:

1. `git clone https://github.com/JulianWebb/Palettizer.git` (or via SSH if you are fancy)
2. `npm install` within the project directory
3. `node .` to run it.

I believe some of the functionality used requires Node v14.

I don't expect anyone to care about this project (I barely do). It was born from need a NodeJS project to learn/practise Docker Image creation with.
